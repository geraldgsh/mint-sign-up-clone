## Introduction

This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com’s signup page

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms

## Project Specific

Pay attention to the type of <input> tags you are going to use in your <form>.

## Steps

1. Go to [Mint.com’s](https://wwws.mint.com/login.event?task=S) signup page and have a look around. The form isn’t exceptionally complicated.

2. Create a blank HTML document.

3. Plan out how the elements on the page need to be grouped together.

4. Lay out the empty semantic HTML elements for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer…) and make them the proper size and alignment. It may be helpful to change their background colors while you’re positioning them on the page. Don’t forget to use your browser’s developer tools (right click on the page, click “inspect element”)!

5. Fill in those elements with the content you want to include.

6. Now style them to look like the real webpage.

7. Push your solution up to Github and you’re good to go!
